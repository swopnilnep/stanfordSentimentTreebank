# Stanford Sentiment Treebank

This was the final project for my DS-120 class at Luther College. The project combines several Python scripts (within Ipython notebooks) to do the filtering and data cleaning and does the majority of sentiment analysis work using Excel sheets. 

The dataset used is a popular dataset for sentiment analysis called the 'Stanford Sentiment Treebank'. 

The overall accuracy of the sentiment analysis project is 90% and is a proof of concept of how sentiment analysis can be achieved in Microsoft Excel.
